# Contributing to Devlix WM

We welcome contributions to Devlix WM! Whether you're reporting bugs, suggesting features, or submitting code, we appreciate your involvement. By contributing to this project, you help make it better for everyone.

Please take a moment to read through the following guidelines to ensure that your contributions go smoothly.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the repository
Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This creates a personal copy where you can make changes without affecting the original project.

### 2. Create a new branch
Before making any changes, create a new branch based on the `main` branch. Name it descriptively, e.g., `fix-bug-description` or `add-feature-name`.

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

### 3. Make your changes
Make the necessary changes to the codebase. Be sure to write clear, concise commit messages, describing why the changes are needed.

### 4. Compile and test your changes
Once you've made your changes, make sure to compile and run Devlix WM to verify that your changes work as expected.

- If you're adding new features or fixing bugs, please ensure that everything is tested properly.
- Check for any issues that might arise during compilation or runtime.

### 5. Update the Wiki (if needed)
If your changes require an update to the documentation or the wiki, please make sure to contribute to the [Devlix Wiki](https://github.com/mohamed1242012/devlix-wiki) and update the relevant pages. This helps keep the documentation up-to-date with the latest changes to the project.

The Devlix Wiki can be accessed here: [wiki.devlix.org](https://wiki.devlix.org).

### 6. Commit your changes
After confirming that everything works, commit your changes with a clear, descriptive message. Please follow this commit message style:

#### Commit Message Style:
- **Use the present tense**: e.g., "Fix bug in layout" instead of "Fixed bug in layout."
- **Be concise but descriptive**: Avoid vague descriptions, be specific about what your commit does.
  
Examples:
- `improve performance in rendering loop`
- `resolve crash when switching workspaces`
- `update setup guide for new installation method`

```bash
git commit -m "add dynamic wallpaper switching functionality"
```

### 7. Push your changes
Push the changes to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

### 8. Submit a pull request
Go to the original repository and submit a pull request (PR). Be sure to include a detailed description of the changes you made and use the [PR template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) provided, the reasoning behind them, and any related issues (if applicable).
